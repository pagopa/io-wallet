# IO Wallet - Common Package

### Introduction

Welcome! ðŸ˜Š

This is the `io-wallet-common`, a NPM package made in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) and different [Azure SDKs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/#javascript) for the IO Wallet app. This package is used by both the `io-wallet-support-func` and `io-wallet-user-func` projects.

This project uses the main fllowing NPM packages:

- [typescript](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/typescript)
- [fp-ts](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/fp-ts)
- [eslint](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/eslint)
- [prettier](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/prettier)
- [@azure/cosmos](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/@azure/cosmos)
- [io-ts](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/io-ts)
- [@pagopa/handler-kit](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/@pagopa/handler-kit)
- [@pagopa/ts-commons](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/@pagopa/ts-commons)

- [vitest](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/vitest)
- [applicationinsights](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/applicationinsights)

This project uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) as dependencies manager. This project is a simple package that is seen as a "container" (NPM package) by all projects that use it. Both projects that are part of this monorepo use `io-wallet-common`.

### Adding io-wallet-common to Other Project

Before following the steps below:

- Make sure your Node version is as specified in the `.node-version` file.
- Make sure you've build the `io-wallet-common` package at the monorepo level. This is a very important package for the `io-wallet-support-func`.

To allow all the other projects to use the `io-wallet-common` package, you must follow these steps:

```bash
# step 1 - installing all dependencies and creating the node_modules/ directory
yarn

# step 2 - building the project and creating the dist/ directory
yarn build

# step 3 - renaming the dist/ folder to io-wallet-common/
mv dist io-wallet-common

# step 4 - copy the io-wallet-common/ folder into the node_modules/ folder of the target project
# in this case, you must change PROJECT_PATH to the relative (or absolute also) path of the project
cp io-wallet-common/ PROJECT_PATH/node_modules
```
