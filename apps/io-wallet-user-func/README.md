# IO Wallet - User Function

### Introduction

Welcome! üòä

This is the `io-wallet-user-func`, a backend porject made in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) and different [Azure SDKs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/#javascript) for the IO Wallet app. This backend includes the necessary functionality used directly from the IO Wallet end users.

This project uses the main fllowing NPM packages:

- [typescript](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/typescript)
- [fp-ts](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/fp-ts)
- [eslint](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/eslint)
- [prettier](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/prettier)
- [@azure/functions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/@azure/functions)
- [@azure/identity](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/@azure/identity)
- [@azure/cosmos](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/@azure/cosmos)
- [tsup](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/tsup)
- [vitest](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/vitest)

This project uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) as depndencies manager.

Moreover, this project is strongly correlated to different [Azure Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=popular) Resources, all available by logging in with your user name directly to the Azure portal. The two most important Azure resources used by this service are [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) and [Azure CosmosDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/).

> ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó if you haven't already, it's strongly recommended to read the `README.md` file at the monorepo level (in the root directory of the monorepo). It will give you more context and a better understanding of how to get this project started. The `io-wallet-user-func` uses the `io-wallet-common` package; you can see under the `packages/` folder of the monorepo.

### Prerequisites

The following dependencies are strongly required:

- Node ^20.13
- Yarn ^4

The following dependencies are optional, but they are necessary to start the service locally in complete autonomy:

- AZ CLI ^2
- Python ^3

If you are interested in infrastructure issues, you may find it convenient to install terraform on your local machine:

- Terraform ^1.7.5

### Installation

```bash
yarn
# or
yarn install
```

### Configuration

This service can be configured by a [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file called `local.settings.json` file. This codebase contains a template file called `local.settings.json.example` you can copy and rewrite as and when you want with.

To copy the environment variables template, run the following command:

```bash
cp local.settings.json.example local.settings.json
```

### Quickstart

Before following the steps below:
- Make sure your Node version is as specified in the `.node-version` file.
- Make sure you've build the `io-wallet-common` package at the monorepo level. This is a very important package for the `io-wallet-user-func`.

To quickly start this project in a local environment, run the following commands in the order they appear:

```bash
yarn            # installing all dependencies and creating the node_modules/ directory
yarn build      # building the project and creating the dist/ directory 
yarn start      # generating different log into your shell
```

To make sure the function is up, just go to a browser and type the following URL in the search bar, which invokes the healthcheck API: `http://localhost:7071/api/v1/wallet/health`. Alternatively, if you have the curl package installed on your operating system, simply open a terminal and type the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7071/api/v1/wallet/health
```

In both cases, you should see the following response, expressed in JSON format:

```json
{ "message": "it works!" }
```

As you can see, the function is listening on `7071` port. You can change the listening port with the following command:

```bash
func start --port YOUR_PORT
```
